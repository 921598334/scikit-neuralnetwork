scikit-neuralnetwork
====================

Deep neural network implementation without the learning cliff!  This is a wrapper for the powerful ``pylearn2`` library that's compatible with ``scikit-learn`` for a more user-friendly and Pythonic interface.

Upcoming Features
-----------------

* An example that covers hand-written digit recognition from the MNIST dataset.
* Better error checking for the layer specifications, useful messages otherwise.
* Use pylearn2's monitoring code to stop training upon detecting convergence.
